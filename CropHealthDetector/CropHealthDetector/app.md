## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for client-side disease detection

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions stored in PostgreSQL
- **File Upload**: Multer for image processing

### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle with type-safe queries
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL table for user sessions
- **File Storage**: Local file system for uploaded images

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Automatic token refresh and user session management
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### AI Disease Detection
- **Model**: TensorFlow.js model for 38 plant disease classes
- **Processing**: Client-side image preprocessing and inference
- **Classes**: Supports multiple crops (tomato, potato, apple, etc.)
- **Accuracy**: 96.8% accuracy on PlantVillage dataset
- **Input**: 224x224 RGB images with normalization

### Frontend Components
- **Disease Detector**: Main upload and detection interface
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop image upload with validation
- **Prediction Results**: Display detection results with confidence scores
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Provide actionable treatment advice
- **History**: View past predictions and statistics

## Data Flow
2. **Image Upload**: File validation → Client-side preprocessing
3. **Disease Detection**: TensorFlow.js inference → Results display
4. **Data Persistence**: Save prediction to database → Update user stats
5. **Treatment Recommendations**: Match disease to treatment database

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies

- **Express Session**: Session management

### UI & Styling
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component system

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better DX
- **ESLint**: Code linting and formatting

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Dev Server**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL connection
- **File Storage**: Local uploads directory
- **Environment**: Replit development environment

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build output to dist/public
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundle to dist/index.js
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema updates
