This file would contain the actual model weights in binary format. Since this is a mock implementation, the actual weights file would be generated by converting a trained Keras model using the tensorflowjs-converter tool. The file would be approximately 5-50MB in size depending on the model architecture.

For development purposes, the application will fall back to mock predictions when the actual model file is not available.
